The engine of the Industrial Internet blockchain
Blockchain value system hybrid computing platform

# Overview
CAVOS is the abbreviation of Computing Architecture of Value Operation System, which refers to the hybrid computing architecture of blockchain value system based on industrial internet. The CAVOS architecture is based on blockchain design and aims to provide a common hybrid computing platform for emerging technology infrastructure including big data, iOT Internet of Things, industrial finance, cloud computing, and open up the business scenarios behind it. The underlying platform and application architecture of the blockchain.


CAVOS designed the architecture of blockchain and sub-chain layering, and adopted the blockchain cellular distribution computing structure to improve the storage and operation efficiency and security boundary of the data on the chain. At the same time, the distributed cloud computing + edge computing framework combined with industry solutions is adopted under the chain, which can effectively connect the industry business logic, thus providing the industrial customers with a computing model based on the alliance chain + chain architecture, and complete with smart contracts. The deployment of the entire business scenario greatly improves the efficiency and security of business operations and underlying computing. At the same time, the underlying public chain provided by CAVOS can maximize the operational efficiency of the related assets Token in the industry and provide a personalized and economic model system.


CAVOS is currently working on the construction of a platform-level computing architecture and the development of a basic privacy public chain. For distributed cloud computing solutions and edge computing solutions under the chain, CVS is completing the technology interface with partners. The intelligent contract layer of the CVS architecture has completed the development of more than a number of industry application scenarios, and has served the industry platform, including supply chain finance, smart city, data security, bank deposit certificate and other scenarios.
